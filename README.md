# Module1-Projects
 ApplePicker, Mission Demolition and Prototype 1

Sierra Conroy

This project makes use of elements from Roll-a-Ball and Apple Picker to create a mini game-like experience! Using the movement and collection system from Roll-a-Ball, the player can obtain collectibles from the floating sun! 

Using the MDA game framework, the mechanics of the game consist of player keyboard movement, with the dynamics showing through in the player's interaction with collecting the sun's falling "gifts."
With the sun shining amongst a sandbox, the aesthetics of summer can be seen. It is through this MDA framework in which this game's design and its features were carefully picked.
